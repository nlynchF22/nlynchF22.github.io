        This is Octavia she is a warframe all about music. Her abilities all surround using music and sound waves to overpower and defaet the enemies. Her abilities can beat damage into people along with the rythm, make a roller ball to make enemies to follow it, grant buffs to those who perform action to her music, and amplify her abilities.
