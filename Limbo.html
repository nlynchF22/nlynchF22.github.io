    <p>
        This is Limbo a very powerful Warframe when in the right hands especially since Limbo has the ability to banish people to a dimension that no one can hurt them but others in there but are still visable out of the pocket dimension he also can, freeze time his pocket dimension, make rifts to his pocket dimension appear randomly on his enemies, and temporarly call in a dome of his pocket dimension at any point in time and he canstill freezethe enemies in the pocket dimension. And another benefit of his pocket dimension is while he or his allies are inside the pocket dimension they regain their energy faster.
