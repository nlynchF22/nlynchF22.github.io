      This is Frost one of the first few frames you ever meet while traveling through the junctions between planets. His abilities revolve around being as tanky as possible and being able to deal heavy melee damage to enemies. His first ability is a charge in the direction he is facing bringing devastating damage and stun to all enemies in his path, his second ability it to make his skin as hard as iron to imporve his armour and reduce his incoming damage, his third ability is to roar that aids in all allies damage for a short time making the damge that they produce to increase by a small amount, and his final ability allows him to stomp on the ground making a shockwave expand from him dealing damage and stun to all enemies.
