        This is Mag a Warframe that can control the magnetism of objects and enemies. She is one of the three starting frames for you to choose from to start your journey with. Her abilities can pull objects/enemies to her, make the bullets of enemies surround her and send them back at the attackers, make the enemies lose all of their armour, and lift all enemies nearby plus any nearby polarized shrapnel and send the shrapnelat the enemies then crushing the enemiesto the ground.
