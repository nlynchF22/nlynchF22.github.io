        This is Volt one of the three frames you can choose from to start your journey with he has the ability to control lightning and electricity to a certain extent like being able to shoot lighting from his hand, increase his speed with electricity, make a shield, and paralyze all nearby enemies with a electric shockwave. Volt is known forbeing one of the fastest frames but not THE fastest frame like Gauss is but he can certainly give Gauss a run forhis money.
